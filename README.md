# VHSHorror
This will be the unity project that I will be working on in the programming tutorial class.

CONTROLS SO FAR: 
Q : Flashlight Toggle
WASD : Move
MOUSE: Camera

Taking place in a dark mysterious forest, VHSHorror will be a proof of concept.
VHSHorror will explore the uncanny nature of computer programs, and how they can feel alienated and isolated from the real world.
The logic of this game will be unpredictable and against what we consider to be realistic. Artificial feeling worlds.
